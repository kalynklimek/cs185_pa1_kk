Feel free to click on any project on the webpage to see the different ways I used p5.js, a javascript library, to make computer art. This was my favorite class at UCSB because I was able to take an artistic approach to computer science and express myself.</td>

Click the link to check out the photos and videos I have created. VSCO is one of my favorite platforms because I am able to express myself and share the way I see the world. Most of the content you see on this site's 'image' and 'video' tab was personally created and/or edited by me using the VSCO application.</td>
